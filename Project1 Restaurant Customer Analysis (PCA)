# ðŸ“Š Marketing Analytics Project â€” Team Project 1 
The team conducted a comprehensive study using PCA and cluster analysis to segment customers and develop targeting strategies.

## ðŸ§© Project Overview
**Goal:**  
To analyze customer-level data to identify patterns, reduce dimensionality, and predict marketing outcomes for better targeting strategies.

## Key Findings
**PCA Analysis (Dataset 1):**
- The team identified four meaningful factors from the psychographic survey:
- Factor 1: Food Quality and Diversity - customers valuing fresh ingredients, diverse menus, and specialty dishes
- Factor 2: Service and Atmosphere Preferences - focus on attentive staff vs. preference for privacy
- Factor 3: Price and Portion Preferences - value-conscious customers seeking fair pricing
- Factor 4: Convenience and Casual Atmosphere - preference for accessible, relaxed dining

**Cluster Analysis (Dataset 2):**
Six distinct customer segments emerged:
1.Service Seekers - value service, moderate spending
2.Casual Diners - infrequent visitors, low spending
3.Social Foodies - dine in groups, atmosphere-focused
Luxury Gourmets - high spenders valuing quality across all dimensions
Selective Tasters - quality-focused but infrequent diners
Fast & Frequent - convenience-oriented, frequent but low-spending
## ðŸ§  Key Insights
- PCA reduced the dataset from 15+ variables to a few key behavioral components that explained over **80% of variance**.  
- K-Means identified **4 distinct customer segments** differing by purchase frequency and engagement level.  
- KNN achieved an accuracy of **~80%** in predicting customer response.  
- Results can help tailor **targeted marketing campaigns** and **customer retention strategies**.

# ðŸ“Š Marketing Analytics Projects

This repository contains my graduate-level marketing analytics project completed in R using **Quarto (.qmd)**.  
The analysis explores **customer behavior and segmentation** using techniques like **PCA, K-Means, and KNN** to extract business insights from marketing data.

---

## ðŸ§© Project Overview
**Goal:**  
To analyze customer-level data to identify patterns, reduce dimensionality, and predict marketing outcomes for better targeting strategies.

**Techniques Used:**
- ðŸ§® **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** â€” to reduce feature complexity and visualize data structure  
- ðŸŽ¯ **K-Means Clustering** â€” to identify distinct customer groups  
- ðŸ¤– **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** â€” to predict customer response or purchase behavior  

---

## ðŸ§  Key Insights
- PCA reduced the dataset from 15+ variables to a few key behavioral components that explained over **80% of variance**.  
- K-Means identified **4 distinct customer segments** differing by purchase frequency and engagement level.  
- KNN achieved an accuracy of **~80%** in predicting customer response.  
- Results can help tailor **targeted marketing campaigns** and **customer retention strategies**.

## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies
- **Language:** R  
- **Environment:** Quarto / RStudio  
- **Libraries:** tidyverse, ggplot2, cluster, caret  
- **File:** `TeamProject2.pdf`,`TeamProject3.pdf`

## ðŸ“ˆ Visualization Examples
The report includes:
- PCA scree plots showing explained variance  
- Cluster visualizations of customer segments  
- KNN confusion matrix and accuracy metrics  

---

## ðŸ’¡ Business Takeaways
- High-value clusters can be prioritized for loyalty programs.  
- Dormant clusters suggest re-engagement opportunities via personalized campaigns.  
- Feature reduction (via PCA) improved model interpretability and reduced noise.

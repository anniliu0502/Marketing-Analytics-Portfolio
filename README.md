**Marketing Analytics Portfolio** <br>
Hi there! I'm Anni! <br>
_Turning data, and curiosity into marketing magic_  <br>

I'm a Marketing Analytics grad who believes the best business decisions are backed by data, creativity, and a dash of strategic thinking. Whether it's predicting what makes customers tick or launching the next viral product, I love diving into the numbers to tell compelling stories. <br>

**What I do:** Transform messy data into "aha!" moments that drive real business results. <br>
**What drives me:** The excitement of finding patterns where others see noise, and creating strategies that actually work. <br>

**Featured Projects** <br>
1. Uniscent Smart Deodorant: From Zero to Market Hero <br>

The Challenge: Launch an AI-powered deodorant that doesn't exist yet in a $9B market <br>
The Plot Twist: Men are really anxious about smelling bad (72% worry about their body scent!) <br>

What I Did: <br>
- Identified a glaring market gap: No smart, personalized deodorant exists <br>
- Decoded consumer psychology: 48% cancel plans with friends over odor anxiety (yikes!) <br>
- Created a killer go-to-market strategy: Pop-up "scent labs" in gyms + viral TikTok challenges <br>
- Projected the numbers: $1.35M Year 1 revenue, 58% profit margin, break-even in 18 months <br>

Competitive Advantage: <br>
Combined tech innovation (AI body odor analysis) with experiential marketing (gym takeovers) and community building (#FreshnessGlowUp). Most importantly, made it eco-friendly for the target audience. <br>

Marketing Strategies: Partnered with athletes, created a drag-and-drop scent customization app, and designed a loyalty program with actual rewards people want. <br>
Skills Flexed: Market research • Brand positioning • Launch strategy • Financial forecasting • Consumer psychology • Omnichannel planning <br>

2. Restaurant Analytics: Where Data Meets Delicious <br> 
- Two-part series on understanding what makes diners choose one restaurant over another <br>
Part I: The Luxury Gourmet Chronicles <br>
Mission: Find the customers worth fighting for <br>
I took 200 restaurant customers and 15 variables about their preferences and used PCA to distill them down to what actually matters: <br>

- Food Quality & Diversity (obviously)
- Service & Atmosphere (the vibe check)
- Price & Portion (the wallet reality)
- Convenience & Casual Atmosphere (the "I'm in sweats" factor)

Then I applied hierarchical clustering on them and discovered... <br>
The "Luxury Gourmets" (20% of customers, 80% of the dream) <br>

- High income, no kids, impeccable taste
- Will pay premium prices for premium experiences
- Basically the customers every restaurant wants to clone

The Go-To-Market Strategies:

- VIP programs for high-spenders (make them feel special, they'll come back)
- Ditch the kids' menu (seriously, this segment doesn't need it)
- Upscale the atmosphere (think date night, not family night)
- Raise prices 10-15% (they won't flinch if quality matches)

Stats: KMO = 0.66, Silhouette Score = 0.62, Validation = TRUE <br>

Part II: Perceptual Mapping: The Restaurant Positioning <br>
Mission: Figure out where Ti Amo stands among 12 competitors <br>
I used Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) to create a "map" of the restaurant landscape based on customer perceptions. Think Google Maps, but for food preferences. <br>
What I Found:<br>

Three customr profiles emerged:

- Premium Squad: High quality + great location (Paramount Grill, The Top, Mildred's)
- Value Seekers: Affordable + good parking (Carrabbas, Las Margaritas, Shoney's)
- The Balanced Middle: Moderate everything (Beef O'Bradys, Bistro 1245) <br>



Ti Amo's Position: Strong on atmosphere, libations, and location—but missing a key segment! <br>
The Golden Opportunity: <br>
Found Customer Cluster 23, 30, 20, 16—high-income folks with no kids who want sophisticated dining but aren't fully served by current positioning. <br>
My Marketing Strategies: <br>

- Reposition as adult-only: Date nights, business dinners, sophisticated gatherings
- Upgrade the vibe: Modern décor, mood lighting, refined presentation
- Tiered pricing: Premium options with some affordable picks
- Target marketing: Go after that $125K income segment

Optimal Model: Ordinal Scaling + Row Conditionality (stress = 0.00596—basically perfect fit) <br>
Skills Flexed: MDS • Unfolding analysis • Competitive positioning • Shepard diagrams • Strategic targeting <br>

3. Starbucks Rewards: Making Loyalty Actually Rewarding <br/>
The Quest: Figure out how to make Starbucks' rewards program even more addictive <br/>
What I Did: <br/>

Designed a comprehensive survey with all the fancy question types: <br/>

- Likert scales (how much do you love us?)
- Ranking questions (what do you really want?)
- Constant-sum allocation (you have 100 points—spend wisely)
- Semantic differentials (rate us on ALL the things)
- Hypothetical scenarios (what if we doubled the stars?)


The Analysis: <br/>

- Real Collected data in Excel 
- Cross-tabbed satisfaction scores with redemption behaviors
- Indexed preferences to find what actually drives loyalty
- Applied the 4Ps framework to build actionable recommendations

The Insight: Not all rewards are created equal—customers value certain perks way more than others, and the program wasn't optimizing for those preferences. <br/>
Business Impact: Identified specific changes to the promotion mix that could boost engagement without increasing costs. <br/>
Skills Flexed: Survey design • Primary research • Excel wizardry • Market research frameworks • Customer segmentation <br/>
